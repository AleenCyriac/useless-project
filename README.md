### Project Description
 where we pretend 
your plant has feelings.
 Using totally fake tech, we detect 
moods like leafy joy, 
silent judgment, and mild despair. It’s pointless. Enjoy!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever wanted to know what your plants feel

Now you can pretend to know what your house plant is feeling with our website 'clingy vitals' where plants show different emotions based on how you interact with them.
